            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>An Expoſition on Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Thirteen Principles.</head>
               <p>THe high calling that every childe of God is called unto, is not this temporall calling which God hath placed us in, but our Election ſtandeth in obedience to know Gods will, and to know what we are by nature, the children of wrath, and fire-brands of hell, if we labour not to know God, and to be aſſured that Chriſt hath redéemed us from the ſecond death, and that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119550:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt us: therefore our true happineſſe is, to labour while we have time, to know our duty to God and man, and to labour to know, that of our ſelves we are loſt in <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, and that Chriſt hath made us frée citizens by his death and reſurrection. For man by nature in himſelf, out of Chriſt, is the unhappieſt of all creatures that God made: therefore in theſe ſad and perilous times, we muſt fit our ſelves for a better life, and whileſt it is to day, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts, but redéem your mis-ſpent time, for the dayes are evill: <hi>Broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that finde it; but narrow is the way that leadeth to everlaſting life, and few there be that finde that ſtrait gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore to labour to knw Chriſt crucified that you may be ſealed for the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
               <p>Firſt, taſte not as <hi>Adam</hi> taſted in eating the forbidden fruit, for which he loſt Paradice, for in this world Paradice is wonne or loſt: Mans life is ſhort, and fraile, in compariſon but a ſpan long, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids us come buy milk without money or price. <hi>Gods</hi> Word is ſwéeter then the honey or the honey combe: therefore let us taſte the benefit that we have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119550:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and let us reliſh that by belief, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaack, Jacob,</hi> and all the Patriarkes, were juſtified: It wet not <hi>Arons</hi> beard alone, but drencht his beard throughout, and finally it did rain down his rich attyre. How precious it is and joyfull, for to ſée Brethren to hold together in the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the bonds of Vnitie: and he that created us for this thing is God, who hath given us the earneſt of his ſpirit: For he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him; which died for us and roſe again.</p>
               <p>Therefore all they that deſire to be in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> let them deny themſelves, and hunger and thirſt after Him and His righteouſneſſe above all the things in the world: For old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new. <hi>Now is the axe laid to the root of the Tree, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tree that bringeth not forth fruit, ſhall be hewen down and caſt into the fire.</hi> Therefore let us deny our own righteouſneſſe, and cry out with Saint <hi>Paul; O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore theſe thirteen Principles holds forth our happineſſe to know what the eſſence of God is, in creating the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to know what we are by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience in eating the forbidden fruit,

All that by the eye of Faith lay hold upon this promiſe, are juſtified. And in fulneſſe of time, God ſent his onely b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, in the breaking of Bread, which ſets forth the breaking of his Body.</p>

               <item>2 Strive with God to get thine heart weaned from the love of this preſent world; a thing which is but hanged on a pin, is ſoon heaved off: things glued together are hardly ſondred, exceſſive love to the world makes the croſſe ten times heavier.</item>
               <item>3 Be much with God in holy duties: when <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> plotted againſt our Saviour, he prepared lot the Paſſover, and laſt Supper: let us be moved with reverence to uſe the meanes to have our ſelves and our families ſay to God, Thou art my hiding place, enter into thy cloſet, ſhut the doore to thee, hide thy ſelf with God, untill the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be over-paſſed.</item>
